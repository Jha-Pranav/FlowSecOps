Docker Desktop for Mac does not run the docker daemon natively on MacOS. It instead installs a Linux VM(https://www.docker.com/blog/the-magic-behind-the-scenes-of-docker-desktop/) and runs Docker there. While there are pros and cons with that approach, one of the cons is that there is no docker0 bridge interface on the host operating system. A side effect is that containers cannot be reached by IP from the host operating system.
