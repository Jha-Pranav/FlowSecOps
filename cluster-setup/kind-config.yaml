networking:
## If you are using Docker on Windows or Mac, you will need to use an IPv4 port forward for the API Server from the host because IPv6 port forwards don’t work on these platforms
#   ipFamily: ipv6   # IPv4 is default 
#   apiServerAddress: 127.0.0.1
  ## WARNING: It is _strongly_ recommended that you keep this the default
  ## (127.0.0.1) for security reasons. However it is possible to change this.


  ## By default the API server listens on a random open port.
  ## You may choose a specific port but probably don't need to in most cases.
  ## Using a random port makes it easier to spin up multiple clusters.
  #apiServerPort: 6443

  ## KIND ships with a simple networking implementation (“kindnetd”) . You can use Clico or other container network interface

## You can create a multi node cluster with the following config:
